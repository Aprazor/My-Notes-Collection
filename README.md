Hi there, my name is Sam. I usually spend most of my time studying something, and whenever I do, I love to take notes. It makes it easy for me to revise things when necessary, and I have Apple to thank for getting back my habit of taking notes. Whenever I take notes, I upload them to this repository so that everyone can benefit from them.
